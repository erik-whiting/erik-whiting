## Hi, I'm Erik!
I'm a professional software engineer and computer science researcher.

:briefcase: I build software for a SaaS company called [CallRail](https://www.callrail.com/) with Ruby on Rails, Angular, NestJS, Docker, and Kubernetes

:school: I'm a CS PhD student at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln

:microscope: I'm a member of the [Yesselman Lab](https://yesselmanlab.com/) where I use software engineering to explore problems in biophysics

🧬 I'm also a member of the [Integrated Digital Omics Lab](https://cse.unl.edu/~qyao/) where I study deep learning applications in bioinformatics

👨‍🎓 I have a BS in computer information systems and an MS in software engineering. [My thesis](https://uhcl-ir.tdl.org/items/71ae039a-7f60-43db-963f-4f08b6fee5a6) was about performance testing 

👨‍🏫 I teach undergraduate programming courses at [Metropolitan Community College]([url](https://www.mccneb.edu/))

🤼 When I'm not writing code, doing science, or teaching, I like to practice the grappling martial arts. I'm mainly into Judo but I've trained BJJ and wrestling as well
