## Hi, I'm Erik!
I'm an RoR programmer by day and researcher by night. 

### Me, professionally ðŸ’»
I work for a SaaS company as a senior software engineer, slinging Ruby on Rails code and an occasional Angular JS line.
I've also been known to tune a database query or two, optimize a CI/CD pipeline, or improve a project's test coverage.

### Me, academically ðŸ”¬
I am an active researcher in the broad area of software engineering. I've published research on test automation,
performance testing, methodologies, and software architecture. In addition to doing research, I also take part in
the peer review process pretty much any time I'm asked.

I'm trying to shift my research focus to the areas of computational biology, genomics, and general scientific computing.
As of now, I'm still a student of these areas, so to speak, and am not currently involved in any relevant research projects.

My degrees:
* BS, Computer Information Systems, University of Houston (2018)
* MS, Software Engineering, University of Houston - Clear Lake (2020)

### Currently working on
I am always working on the Lulu suite of software quality assurance tools and am at varying stages of involvement and work
with the following projects:
* LuluTest - a browser automation framework (Python, Selenium)
* LuluPerfTest - a multithreaded load testing framework (Java)
* LuluTestBed - a fake website for playing with different software QA tools

### Currently Learning
I'm learning as much as I can about scientific computing and decided to start with bioinformatics. So far, I've been
going through a Biopython tutorial and reading papers and articles about the field. I want to do more focused study
in this area when time allows.

I want to also learn about numerical methods. This is a really interesting area but my educational background has
left me lacking in much of the prerequisite knowledge to dive straight in. As such, my learning journey in this area,
like my learning journey in most areas, consists of several half-baby-steps.
